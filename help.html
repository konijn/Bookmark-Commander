Most of itsfeatures are borrowed from Midnight Commander.The screen of the Bookmark Commander is divided into four parts. Almost all ofthe screen space is taken up by two bookmark panels. The bottom line shows thefunction key labels. The topmost line is the menu bar line.The Bookmark Commander provides two views of your Chrome bookmarks at the sametime. One of the panels is the current panel (<span class="selected">a teal selection bar</span> will signalwhich panel is active), almost all operations take place on the current panel.Some bookmarks operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory ofthe unselected panel as a destination.One of the differences with Midnight Commander is that copying and moving bookmarks is instantaneous, there is no opportunity to rename the bookmark. That'swhy all bookmark folders will be always be copied/moved recursively.This is a list of the keys that work in Bookmark Commander :Down : move selection bar one spot lowerUp   : move selection bar one spot higherTab  : change panelF1   : helpF5   : copyF6   : moveF7   : create bookmark folderF8   : deleteF9   : open top menuF10  : close Bookmark Commander+    : move selected bookmark higher-    : move selected bookmark lowerFor Macs: To press F9 hit 'Esc', then '9'. To press F10 hit 'Esc', then '0'.WARNING: there is no undo, with great powers comes great sorrow.You can start up the Bookmark Commander by hitting the <IMG SRC="bc-32x32.png" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALT="MC"> icon on the top rightside of Chrome. </body></html>
